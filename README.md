The Global Terrorism Database [GTD](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2019. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 200,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism [START](https://www.start.umd.edu), headquartered at the University of Maryland.

The GTD defines terrorist attacks as
> The threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation

* Clean the data
* [Prepare](https://github.com/SamarpanDas/Global-Terrorism-Analysis/tree/main/project/1.%20Prepare) the data for processing and analysis
* Perform data [pre-processing](https://github.com/SamarpanDas/Global-Terrorism-Analysis/blob/main/project/2.%20Process/data_preprocessing.ipynb) to manipulate the data for analysis and draft out targetted tabels for analysis
* [Analyze](https://github.com/SamarpanDas/Global-Terrorism-Analysis/blob/main/project/3.%20Analysis%20and%20Visualisations/data_analysis.ipynb) the data more deeply and extract insights
